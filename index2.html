                <h2>Identify Wastes</h2>
                <p>The University provides safe, effective, and efficient waste management services for managing  
                nonhazardous solid waste, recyclable waste, and hazardous waste. The University community is 
                responsible for identifying the type of waste produced and using the appropriate University 
                management system.</p>

                <h2>Evaluate Waste</h2>
                <p>The University community must evaluate their waste for its physical, chemical, and biological
                characteristics to determine how it is to be properly managed. It is applying objective, documented
                information and scientific or industry-accepted reasoning to determine that a waste is not hazardous.</p>

                <p>Once wastes have been identified and evaluated, the University community must manage it according to
                applicable University of Minnesota waste management instructions. These waste management instructions 
                have been developed to keep the University in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and 
                to promote a safe and healthy workplace.</p>
