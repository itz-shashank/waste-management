    <h2>Education and Awareness</h2>
    <p>The Education and Awareness subcommittee is prioritizing coordinated communication between all relevant waste
         management decision-makers in order for consistent communication to be planned and implemented by University
         stakeholders. A protocol will be put into place for all University units to follow prior to making any changes
        to waste management. Access to educational materials will be improved via development of a centralized website, 
        which will be managed jointly by the Office of Physical Plant and the Sustainability Institute; a possible app; 
        and improved online engagement. Sustainability initiatives will be branded through signage and organizational 
        messaging to increase trust and transparency in waste management initiatives that should lead to increased 
        involvement among constituents.</p>
        <p>This subcommittee focused on effectively communicating Penn State initiatives regarding waste to various 
        stakeholders (e.g., students, faculty, and staff, as well as visitors to campus and sporting events) via 
        consistent but easily modifiable messaging. Without appropriate communication or messaging, efforts to 
        reduce waste made by the University are unlikely to be successful. Individuals need to have, at a minimum, 
        proper information about appropriate behavior (e.g., how to recycle and compost appropriately at Penn State
        campuses as well as education regarding benefits and programs to reuse water bottles, mugs, and food containers).
        However, information / education alone is not enough for a successful campus-wide waste reduction campaign as 
        individuals also need to have the motivation to follow through (via removal of barriers to desired behavior and
        social norms). This necessary shift in behavior could be achieved through greater awareness and appropriate 
        messaging that resonates with engaged individuals.</p>
        <p>As a leading waste management company in India, we take our responsibilities seriously. Everything we do is 
        focused on delivering an excellent customer experience, as well as serving to protect the environment, our 
        people, and the public.</p>
