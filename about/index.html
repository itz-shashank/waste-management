                    <h3>Our aim of waste management is to reduce the dangerous effects of such waste on the 
                        environment and human health. A big part of waste management deals with municipal solid waste,
                         which is created by industrial, commercial, and household activity.Waste management practices 
                        are not uniform among countries (developed and developing nations); regions (urban and rural areas),
                        and residential and industrial sectors can all take different approaches.Proper management of 
                        waste is important for building sustainable and liveable cities, but it remains a challenge for
                        many developing countries and cities. A report found that effective waste management is 
                        relatively expensive, usually comprising 20%â€“50% of municipal budgets. Operating this essential 
                        municipal service requires integrated systems that are efficient, sustainable, and socially 
                        supported.</h3>
